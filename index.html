<h1>Hi everyone!</h1>
<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>I am <span>Joanna Coll</span> I am a hard-working, motivated woman on the path to a dream career as a full-stack Javascript developer. My strength is being detail-oriented and always thinking of the needs of the end user. My experience before tech is with human resources, event planning and business administration. I am a permanent resident of Polish origin. </p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>My free time I dedicate to travelling or trying new cuisines. Yes, I can definetely call myself a gastroturist. I would travel just to eat some new unique dish.
I also enjoy going out with me friends and learning new concepts.
